<h3>Keynotes</h3>

<h4>Learning beyond Backpropoagation - Geoffrey Hinton</h4>

Back prop has become the workhorse in ML - Geoffrey Hinton challenges the community to rethink learning introducing the Forward-Forward Algorithm that are trained to have high goodness on positive and low goodness on negative samples.

<h4>An introduction to Conformal Prediction - Emmanuel Candès</h4>

Giving models an understanding of what they do not know, is for many decision-making applications as important as providing accurate predictions.

Emanuel Candès (Stanford University) gave a broad introduction to conformal prediction with quantile regression to filter out low confidence predictions.

<h4>Challenges, limitations and paths forward for Causal Inference - Peter Spirtes (CausalML workshop)</h4>

Causality is at the core of key problems in healthcare and is receiving more attn at NeurIPS:

In the causalML for real world impact workshop, causality pioneer Peter Spirtes (Carnegie Mellon University) outlines challenges, limitations and paths forward for causal inference-

<h4>Causal Inference - Stefan Bauer</h4>

Stefan Bauer (KTH Stockholm and CIFAR) presented a wealth of recent research on real-world uses of causal inference including single-cell gene network inference, learning neural causal models from perturbational data, and optimal experimental design for causal discovery.
