<h3>Machine Learning for Drug Discovery (MLDD)</h3>

The first event of the week was the Machine Learning for Drug Discovery (MLDD) symposium featuring a stellar lineup of speakers: Lucy Colwell, David Baker, Pascal Notin, Thore Graepel, Smita Krishnaswamy, Shantanu Singh, and Žiga Avsec.

<h4>Generating and Analyzing Molecules via Learnable Geometric Scattering - Smita Krishnaswamy</h4>

Smita Krishnaswamy (Yale University) introduced graph scattering synthesis (GRASSY) that permits the steered generation of molecules via latent space interpolation.

<h4>Reflections on AI, Rejuvenation and Emergence - Thore Graepel</h4>

Thore Graepel (Altos Labs) presented an insightful view on the intriguing parallels between the scientific fields of rejuvenation and AI and between agent-based reinforcement learning and drug discovery with a view on emergence across ML systems and medicine.

<h3>Keynotes</h3>

<h4>Delusion of Scaling and Democratization of Generative Models - Björn Ommer</h4>

Björn Ommer (Stable Diff) starts us off with defining human vision as grasping things without touch and perception as a process of prediction.
He argues intelligence is learning under finite resources to support research outside scaling & makes case for accessible and open models.

<h4>Systems for Foundation Models, and Foundation Models for Systems - Chris Re</h4>

In a captivating talk, Chris Ré shows us the potential of foundation models (FMs) for systems and introduces the paradigm shift behind FMs: from solve in detail, to solve in general
He outlines data cleaning as a valuable example where FM have made huge strides (also OSS models)

<h3>Selected papers</h3>

<h4>De novo Drug Design using Reinforcement Learning with Multiple GPT Agents</h4>

Xinyuan Hu et al (Microsoft Research, Tsinghua University) introduce a multi GPT agent framework for de-novo drug design with RL with the goal of promoting diverse candidate generation.
Agents use memory, and they show candidate inhibitors for SARS-CoV2.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Overall, key observations are:
- Health and bio is coming of age in the ML community (though still mostly relegated to posters)
- Sequence learning, proteomics and design tasks are emerging as areas of especially high activity and promise for ML in bio
