So much happening in ML for Biology and Health at ICLR and MLDD this year and no time to catch up?

As always, we've got you covered with a concise summary of ICLR and MLDD 2024 content focussed at the buzzing intersection of Bio, Health and AI!

<h3>Machine Learning for Drug Discovery (MLDD)</h3>

The first event of the week was the Machine Learning for Drug Discovery (MLDD) symposium featuring a stellar lineup of speakers: Lucy Colwell, David Baker, Pascal Notin, Thore Graepel, Smita Krishnaswamy, Shantanu Singh, and Žiga Avsec.

<h4>Generating and Analyzing Molecules via Learnable Geometric Scattering - Smita Krishnaswamy</h4>

Smita Krishnaswamy (Yale University) introduced graph scattering synthesis (GRASSY) that permits the steered generation of molecules via latent space interpolation.

<h4>Reflections on AI, Rejuvenation and Emergence - Thore Graepel</h4>

Thore Graepel (Altos Labs) presented an insightful view on the intriguing parallels between the scientific fields of rejuvenation and AI and between agent-based reinforcement learning and drug discovery with a view on emergence across ML systems and medicine.

<h4>Accurate proteome-wide missense variant effect prediction with AlphaMissense - Žiga Avsec</h4>

Žiga Avsec (Google DeepMind) introduced us to the exciting world of genetic sequence models with their recent work on accurately predicting the pathogenicity of missense variants using AlphaMissense.

<h4>Cell Painting powers next-generation phenotypic drug discovery - Shantanu Singh</h4>

Shantanu Singh (Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard) gave us a whirlwind tour through the exciting world of using cell painting datasets for drug discovery with many applications from gene characterisation to measuring complex phenotypes to virtual screening.

<h4>Machine Learning to predict protein function from sequence with therapeutic applications - Lucy Colwell</h4>

Lucy Colwell (Google Research and University of Cambridge) showcased outstanding work on (1) better understanding the sequence to function link and using this understanding to design candidate sequences  and on (2) combining language and sequences to find proteins via text descriptions of their function.

<h3>Keynotes</h3>

<h4>Delusion of Scaling and Democratization of Generative Models - Björn Ommer</h4>

Björn Ommer (Stable Diff) starts us off with defining human vision as grasping things without touch and perception as a process of prediction.
He argues intelligence is learning under finite resources to support research outside scaling & makes case for accessible and open models.

<h3>Selected papers</h3>

<h4>De novo Drug Design using Reinforcement Learning with Multiple GPT Agents</h4>

Xinyuan Hu et al (Microsoft Research, Tsinghua University) introduce a multi GPT agent framework for de-novo drug design with RL with the goal of promoting diverse candidate generation.
Agents use memory, and they show candidate inhibitors for SARS-CoV2.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Overall, key observations are:
- Health and bio is coming of age in the ML community (though still mostly relegated to posters)
- Sequence learning, proteomics and design tasks are emerging as areas of especially high activity and promise for ML in bio
