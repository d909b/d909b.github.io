          <div class="container" style="margin-bottom:12px">
            <p>
            I am Director of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at <a href="https://www.gsk.ai/">GSK AI/ML</a>. My work aims to advance personalised medicine and drug discovery by utilising machine learning and computational systems biology methods and large-scale health data, such as genetics, multi-omics, cell-based assays, and continuous measurements from smart devices and electronic health records, to better understand and treat complex diseases.
            </p>

            <p>
            Prior to joining GSK, I was a Principal Architect working on Machine Learning for Personalised Medicine at <a href="https://www.roche.com/">Roche</a> in Basel, Switzerland and at <a href="https://www.gene.com/">Genentech</a> in South San Francisco, US. Before joining Roche, I was a doctoral researcher working on Machine Learning for Healthcare at ETH Zurich where I worked, in close collaboration with students, medical researchers, clinical experts and industrial professionals from University Hospital Zurich, the Balgrist clinic and Hocoma AG, on applying machine learning methods in the medical domain. Prior to that, I collected 5 years of experience in using machine learning to automate business processes and engineering custom software solutions in industry. I hold a PhD in Machine Learning (2019) from ETH Zurich, Switzerland, a MSc in Computer Science (2015) with distinction from the University of Vienna, Austria and a BSc in Computer Science (2013) with honors from Technikum Vienna, Austria.
